        |```
        | !open (!ROLE COUNT)+     -- Sets up the team roster.
        | !abort                   -- Abandons the roster and does not build a team.
        | !close                   -- Closes the roster and finalizes a team.
        | !assign (@USER !ROLE)+   -- Assigns members to roles in the team.
        | !release @USER+          -- Releases previously assigned members.
        | !offer @USER !ROLE+      -- Volunteers a member for one or more roles.
        | !kick @USER !ROLE*       -- Kicks a member from one or more roles (or all roles if you don't list any).```
        |Note that you have to be an event administrator to use the above commands. Here's the commands for everyone:
        |```
        | !ROLE+                   -- Volunteers YOU for one or more roles.
        | !drop !ROLE*             -- Drops YOU from one or more roles (or all roles if you don't list any).
