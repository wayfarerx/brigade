# circumvolve
Circumvolve is a Discord bot that tries to assist in building optimal-but-fair teams on a repeating basis. The basic idea is that *administrators* set up a roster specifying what *roles* they require and how many *members* they require for each role. For example: a traditional MMO dungeon group would look something like:
 - 1 Tank
 - 1 Healer
 - 2 Damage dealers
 
Circumvolve enables administrators to ask for these roles to be filled and allows members to volunteer to fill those roles, all without direct human intervention.
